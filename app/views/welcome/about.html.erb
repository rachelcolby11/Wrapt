      <h3 class='header'><em>There's a special kind of panic that sets in when you realize it's almost your anniversary, or the holidays, or a loved one's birthday... and you have absolutely nothing in the works. It's not that you don't care - you tried to listen for hints - and yet somehow you seem to draw a total blank every time it's gift-giving time.</em></h3>
      <div class='about-text'>
      <p>The idea for Wrapt was born one evening in December when I realized once again that I had no idea what to get anyone on my holiday list, a problem that was all too familiar. Somewhere in the back of my mind, a little voice asked, "What happened to the joy of giving?"</p>
      <h4><em>Wouldn't it be easy, I thought, if I could just access everyone's most up-to-date wishlist whenever I wanted? And wouldn't it be great to have my own wishlist in one place, where my friends and relatives could see it? </em></h4>
      <p>At Wrapt, we're working hard to transform gift-giving and gift-getting back to the joyful experience they were meant to be, and we've got helpful features you won't find anywhere else:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Restrict viewing permissions on your items: Want your friends to see different items than your relatives? Don't want Uncle Bob or Aunt Jean picking out clothes for you? Wrapt has you covered!</li>
        <li>Claim a gift: Stake your claim to guarantee your gift won't be duplicated! We'll help you keep track of the items you've claimed with your own shopping list.</li>
        <li>Conveniently view your friends' upcoming birthdays, your shopping list, and more as soon as you log in.</li>
      </ul>
