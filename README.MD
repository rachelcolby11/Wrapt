## [Wrapt](https://wrapt.herokuapp.com/)

Wrapt, my capstone project at Bloc.io, is a Ruby on Rails application that allows users to create a wishlist of gifts and view their friends'â€‹ lists as well. I built Wrapt so that people could access up-to-date wishlists from their friends and family all in one place, and update their own wishlist without feeling obnoxious. It's designed to make the process of gift-giving and gift-receiving easier, less stressful, and more gratifying for everyone involved.

* The app is deployed on Heroku: https://wrapt.herokuapp.com 
* The source code is here on GitHub: https://github.com/rachelcolby11/Wrapt

#### Features
* Users can create an account, make a profile describing their preferences, and create a list of gifts they would like to receive.
* Users can share their profile and gift list with other users, allowing them to view their preferences and desired items.
* Users can invite friends and family to join the site and view their gift list.
* Users can view a list of friends who can see their gift list, and a list of friends who have allowed them to view their lists.
* Users can add, edit, or remove items from their gift list, and update their profile and preferences at any time.
* Users can restrict viewing permissions on items so that only certain friends can see them.
* Users can "claim" an item they plan to purchase. (The person who created the item cannot see that the item has been claimed.)
* Seven days after claiming a gift, users receive a reminder to purchase the gift or release their claim so that others can purchase it.
* Users can create, edit, and delete quick notes of gift ideas they think of.
* After signing in, users are directed to a dashboard showing the items they have claimed, the notes they have made, and a list of friends whose birthdays are approaching within the next three months. 
* Users who still need to fill out their profile or add their birthday will see a reminder to do so at the top of the dashboard.
